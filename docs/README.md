# Technical Documentation

This directory contains **permanent technical documentation** for the QuantumMateria Story Engine project.

## Files

### `architecture.md`
The single source of truth for all technical architecture decisions, including:
- Database schema design and relationships
- API endpoint specifications  
- Tech stack rationale and implementation patterns
- Agent coordination strategy
- Quality assurance framework

This document is referenced by all development agents and serves as the foundation for implementation decisions.

## Purpose

These documents represent the **permanent knowledge base** of the project:
- **Always relevant**: Core technical decisions that persist across development phases
- **Reference material**: Used by agents and developers for implementation guidance
- **Architectural history**: Tracks validated design decisions and their rationale
- **Implementation guide**: Provides blueprints for feature development

## Maintenance

- Updated when architectural decisions change
- Maintained as living documentation reflecting current system design
- Version controlled to track evolution of technical decisions
- Should remain stable and comprehensive for long-term project reference
