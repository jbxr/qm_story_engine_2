# Session Log - QuantumMateria Story Engine

## Session 1: 2025-01-12 - Project Initialization & Planning

### Context
Starting fresh implementation of story engine following spec-driven development methodology. User provided comprehensive specs in `.specs/` directory and requested agent-coordinated implementation.

### Agents Used
- **research**: Web search for spec-driven development best practices
- **planning**: Architecture design and session management strategy

### Completed Tasks
‚úÖ **Documentation Framework Setup**
- Created docs/architecture.md as technical single source of truth
- Created project/tasks.md with dependency-ordered task breakdown  
- Created project/session-log.md for multi-session continuity
- Established agent coordination strategy

‚úÖ **Requirements Analysis**
- Analyzed all 9 spec documents in `.specs/` directory
- Identified core feature dependencies and implementation order
- Validated tech stack decisions (FastAPI + SQLModel + Supabase)

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Agent-First Implementation**: Use specialized agents for each phase
2. **Documentation-Driven**: 50% time investment in specs/architecture (best practice)
3. **Session Persistence**: Structured documentation for multi-session continuity
4. **Phase-Based Development**: 5 phases from foundation to LLM integration

### Implementation Plan Overview
```
Phase 1: Foundation (Models, DB setup)
Phase 2: Basic CRUD (Scene blocks, entities)  
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Goals, knowledge)
Phase 4: Semantic Search & LLM
Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
```

### Next Session Priorities
1. Use **backend-architect** agent to validate SQLModel schema design
2. Use **file-creator** agent for project scaffolding
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (T1.1-T1.13)

### Architecture Insights
- Supabase + pgvector essential for semantic search capabilities
- SQLModel provides clean bridge between API and database layers
- Agent coordination prevents context bloat in complex implementation
- Spec-driven approach ensures quality and maintainability

### Blockers/Issues
- None identified yet
- Need to validate Supabase schema matches SQLModel definitions

### Code Changes
