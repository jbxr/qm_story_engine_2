# Implementation Tasks - QuantumMateria Story Engine

## üèÜ Strategic Evolution Approach

**Backend-Architect Validation**: "ARCHITECTURALLY EXCELLENT"

This task breakdown represents an **evolutionary architecture** approach where Phase 1 provides a strategic foundation that preserves all future development paths while proving core concepts immediately.

## Evolution Phases Status
