## Task Assignment Strategy

### Agent Coordination
- **file-creator**: T1.2, T1.3 (Project structure, configuration files)
- **backend-architect**: T1.6-T1.13, T2.1-T2.3 (Schema design, core APIs)
- **rapid-prototyper**: T2.4-T2.10, T3.1-T3.4 (CRUD implementation, basic features)
- **ai-engineer**: T4.1-T4.9 (Semantic search, LLM integration)
- **test-writer-fixer**: T5.1-T5.5 (Test framework, coverage)

### Completion Criteria
Each task is considered complete when:
1. Code is implemented and functional
2. Basic tests pass (where applicable)  
3. Documentation is updated
4. Changes are committed with descriptive messages

### Blocking Dependencies
- **Phase 2** cannot start until Phase 1 T1.6-T1.13 (models) are complete
- **Phase 3** requires Phase 2 T2.4-T2.7 (scene blocks) to be functional
- **Phase 4** needs Phase 3 T3.5-T3.8 (knowledge system) for LLM context
- **Phase 5** testing can start alongside Phase 2 implementation
